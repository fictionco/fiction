title: Wear Black
---

When you travel a lot, you quickly realize that the more things you have with you - the more difficult it becomes to move from place to place. Checking a bag becomes one of the sources of the greatest frustrations.

In the last year alone, I've lost my bag three times. In one scenario I had to hire someone to help me get it back (in Ukraine), in another, the bag was simply stolen (never to be seen again).

So if you're like me you've decided to travel light. And that leads me to the subject of this article and one of the greatest minimalist hacks there is: wear black clothes.

Now, you might say: “I can't wear all black, I love my multicolored attire.” Well, just let me show you how much black clothing can simplify and improve your travel life.

## It means traveling with less stuff

When I decided to start traveling full time about a year and a half ago, the first thing I did was buy a massive bag, large enough to pack a fat 14 year old child. I perceived I would need to store my months long supply of clothes and other accessories.

However, when y0u travel a lot, a big bag like this is a pain. You have to wait in lines, it gets lost, you have to pay fees, etc… I realized I needed to go to the ‘carry on’ only model, but how? That’s right, I got rid of the brown shoes, blue pants, multicolored shirts, etc… black always matches black.

## Blue jeans are ugly. Brown shoes are pointless.

In this bag I had black and brown shoes, black and blue pants, etc… First, let me ask you… why does everyone wear blue jeans? Why blue? I contend that black jeans will always be better than blue. You can wear black jeans to formal as well as casual events, black jeans look great with most colors while blue doesn’t. That’s right, people wear blue just because that’s what everyone else does.

## It simplifies your life

Black matches black, and most importantly, no one notices if you were the same thing multiple times.

That’s right. You can wear the same shirt two days in a row, no one notices. Same shoes, jacket, etc… it doesn’t matter. The same thing doesn’t apply for different color clothing. Wear that striped blue shirt two days in a row and you will be the laughing stock of your neighborhood.

So stop playing the whole “you need to wear something different every day,” or the “you can only wear these shoes with this color shirt” game that the fashion companies continually push in an effort to sell more clothes.

## It doesn’t get dirty

Black clothing is really hard to get dirty. Coffee stain? What coffee stain.

This means you can wear black shoes and clothing for longer before they start to look old and worn out. Perfect for us nomads.

One caveat, you still have to worry about is cats. I can verify that cat hair and black clothes can still be a problem.
