# User Experience Design: How to Improve and Best Practices

## The key to launching a successful product

It’s a proven fact that UX design can make or break a business by heavily impacting its customer loyalty levels. 82% of top-performing businesses admit that they prioritize usability across their digital touchpoints.

By taking your users' experience and opinions into account, you raise their satisfaction and increase the number of users purchasing your services or products. It’s something you can actively improve by surveying your audience and researching their preferences.

## What is UX design?

In simple terms, UX design is the process of increasing user satisfaction and making sure that the services you provide to your customers deliver value. This is often measured through metrics like mobile use, the number of returning visitors, conversion rates, and others.

The quality of user experience design lies in the following qualities:

- Usefulness
- Usability
- Desirability
- Accessibility
- Findability
- Credibility
- Value for business and its sponsors

## UX design best practices

Effective UX is all about catering your design to your audience so that they feel confident and comfortable while meeting their end goal.

### Understand who your audience is

UX design should start with gaining an intimate understanding of who your users are. There are several methods of learning about their needs and expectations, which include running surveys, talking to them directly, or collecting insights from analytics software. You should always design by looking at your product through the eyes of your users; ask yourself, “what are they trying to get from our product?”

Here are a few questions you should aim to answer in the discovery phase of your product:

- What problems are the users looking to solve?
- How can this product address their goals and needs?
- What makes people choose this product over competing solutions on the market?

### Seek simplicity and familiarity

Your audience doesn’t want to relearn how to use an app or a website, and, thus, it’s your job not to entirely reinvent the wheel when it comes to user experiences. Rely on existing behavioral patterns to design solutions your users are familiar with.

Simplicity and familiarity in your designs and features will help your users achieve their goals faster and more efficiently.

### Observe how your users interact with your design

You can’t know what to alter or improve unless you know what the user experience is truly like. Use Darwin's session replays or in-person usability testing to find out how your audience interacts with the design you have created.

What do they like? What do they struggle with? How can you make elements of your design more intuitive (and, thus, create a faster and more efficient experience)?

### Make sure the entire user flow is consistent

A user flow shows all the steps that a user has to take to achieve their goals. When you consider how a person will move throughout your website or app, you should ask yourself:

- Do they reach their goal at the end?
- Do they encounter any interruptions along the way?
- Are there any steps that could be simplified or omitted altogether?

User journey mapping is one way that you can narrow down any under-performing areas in user flow and address it in your UX design.

### Prioritize readability

The text you display in your product needs to be legible and promote maximum readability. Readability is the ease at which the reader can understand the written text. While you may have text that is grammatically correct, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s easily readable. Aim at making it easy to understand for all age groups by using a familiar language.

## Final thoughts

User experience helps to increase user satisfaction and usability. When you focus on user experience design, you increase your company’s potential and open yourself up to the opportunity of providing greater value to your customers.
